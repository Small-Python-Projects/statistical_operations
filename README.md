# statistical_operations
More complex (but still simple) data processing. Once more, my coding etiquette and skill evidently improves from the files in mathematical_operations. In filewordsort.py, the function is to take a file of words that the user inputs, sort them, and output a new file that has sorted these words that the user also names.
Histogram.py creates a histogram based on data provided in a file. The montecarlo_pi program calculates Pi from a simulation of an entered number of darts hitting a dart board.
Fourier plots a Fourier transform based on data in an accompanying CSV file, the same is then done with the determination of Planck's constant. There was an issue (out of my control) with my raw data so a colleague's raw data was used to help!
Txt and CSV files are necessary for the programmes to run.
